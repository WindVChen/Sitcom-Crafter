In an intense boxing match, one is continuously punching while the other is defending and counterattacking.
With fiery passion two dancers entwine in Latin dance sublime.
Two fencers engage in a thrilling duel, their sabres clashing and sparking as they strive for victory.
The two are blaming each other and having an intense argument.
Two good friends jump in the same rhythm to celebrate.
Two people bow to each other.
Two people embrace each other.
